In Python's threading module, there isn't a built-in `run()` function that directly relates to starting threads, but the `run()` method is an integral part of the threading infrastructure. When you create a thread by extending the `Thread` class, you can override the `run()` method. This method defines what code the thread will execute when started. You don't call `run()` directly; instead, it is invoked internally when you call the thread's `start()` method.

### How `run()` Works

The `run()` method is the entry point for a thread. In the threading module, the `Thread` class's `start()` method internally calls `run()`. If you're creating a thread by extending the `Thread` class, you would override the `run()` method to specify the activity that should be performed by the thread.

### Example without Using `run()` Directly

You can create a thread without directly using or overriding the `run()` method by passing a target function to the `Thread` constructor:

```python
import threading

def my_function():
    print("My function is running.")

thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

### Example with Overriding `run()`

However, if you're subclassing the `Thread` class, you would override the `run()` method:

```python
import threading

class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    def run(self):
        print("My custom thread is running.")

# Create a new thread instance
my_thread = MyThread()

# Start the thread, which calls run() internally
my_thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to complete
my_thread.join()
```

### Conclusion

The `run()` method is a crucial part of the threading module's `Thread` class. It's where the thread's activity is defined. You can either directly use the `Thread` class with a target function, which abstracts away the need for you to deal with the `run()` method, or you can subclass the `Thread` class and override `run()` to have custom thread behavior. Either way, the thread is started with the `start()` method, not by directly calling `run()`.
